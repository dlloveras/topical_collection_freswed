\begin{abstract}
Observational techniques play an essential role in advancing our understanding of the physics of the solar corona, providing in particular validation data for three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the solar atmosphere. Solar rotational tomography is currently the sole observational technique that provides a 3D quantitative description of the solar corona at a global scale. Based on \diego{extreme ultraviolet} data of space borne instruments, {differential emision measure tomography (DEMT)} allows constructing 3D maps of the coronal electron density and temperature at heliocentric heights below $\approx 1.25\,\mrsun$. We carry out a study of the corona combining {DEMT} reconstructions with MHD simulations using the latest version of the Alfv\'en Wave Solar Model (AWSoM) of the Space Weather Modeling Framework. Target rotations were selected from the solar minimum between solar cycles (SC) 23 and 24 and {the declining} phase of SC 24. The 3D tomographic and MHD models are analysed and compared in distinct coronal magnetic structures. {We report in quantitative detail on the 3D termodinamic structure of the inner corona as revealed by the DEMT analysis. We show in particular the existence of diverse types of temperature structures in the low and mid latitudes of the streamer belt, and that the heating energy required to keep them stable may be accounted for by Alfvén waves. We show that the latest version of the AWSoM model results agree with DEMT reconstructions to within a $\approx 20\%$ accuracy or better. We report on aspects of the AWSoM model that could be improved to better reproduce the DEMT results, in particular concerning the source region of the fast/slow solar winds.}

\section{Introduction}\label{intro} 

Being the place where the solar atmosphere is heated and the solar wind accelerated, and where impulsive events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections are energized, observation and modeling of the solar corona are tasks of great relevance to improve our understanding of the Sun-Earth environment. To advance our knowledge of the physics of the solar corona, as well as to improve its three-dimensional (3D) models, information derived from observational data plays a key role. Solar rotational tomography (SRT) is currently the sole observational technique able to provide a quantitative empirical description of the 3D distribution of some fundamental plasma parameters of the solar corona at a global scale.

\noindent\notebyalbert{Here we will put in a couple of paragraphs summarizing what SRT and DEMT are, including references and defining the accronyms in the process. We should refer to minima in particular. We should mention the instruments and missions we use as data for DEMT, and define their accronyms too. Also one paragraph on the SWMF/AWSoM model, including references and defining the accronyms on the way.}

To study the global coronal 3D structure, SRT proved to be a powerful tool. Based on solar rotation, allow instruments to compile a time series of images that cover the entire corona. 

{Based on time-series of \diego{extreme ultraviolet (EUV)} images, differential emission measure tomography (DEMT) allows reconstruction of the 3D distribution of the differential emission measure (DEM) of the \diego{quiet-Sun low corona at a global scale.} The technique was first developed by \citet{frazin_2009}, and first applied to the observational study of coronal structures by \citet{vasquez_2009}. Using solar rotation time series of EUV images taken in channels sensitive to different temperatures, the technique allows calculation of 3D maps of electron density and temperature in the heliocentric height range $1.0\,\mrsun$ to $1.2\,\mrsun$ as summarized in Section \ref{demt}. The reader may refer to the recent review by \citet{vasquez_2016} that summarizes the DEMT technique.

\diego{
A combination of the DEMT and global magnetic models has provided useful insight into the 3D thermodynamical structure of the global quiet-Sun corona. Recently \citet{lloveras_2017} combined DEMT whit coronal magnetic field of the global corona modeled by means of potential field source surface to study the last two solar minima.
 More recently, \citet{sachdeva_2019} compared the results of the latest version of the Alfvén Wave Solar Model (AWSoM) of the Space Weather Modeling Framework model with observations for the same rotations as this article in a globally fashion, obtaining good agreement up to 1 AU.
We used AWSoM results with two purposes. On the one hand to provide thermodynamic results to be contrasted with DEMT, and on the other hand to provide magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) coronal magnetic field model that is used to study thermodynamics along field lines.
}
We carry out a quantitatively detailed comparative \diego{DEMT/AWSoM} analysis of the Carrington Rotation (CR)-2082 during the Solar Cycle (SC) 23/24 minimum and CR-2208 during the declining fase of SC 24. To study CR-2082 data taken by the \textit{Extreme UltraViolet Imager Behind} (EUVI-B) on board the \textit{Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory} (STEREO) was used, while data taken by the \textit{Atmospheric Imaging Assembly instrument} (AIA), on board the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO) mission was used to study CR-2208.

\diego{
Section \ref{demt} and \ref{awsom} summarizes DEMT technique, AWSoM model, instruments, and datasets we used. Section \ref{trace} explains the technique that is used to trace the thermodynamic results along the field lines. Section \ref{energia} details the energy model and the loop integrated quantities that are part of the comparative analysis. In Section \ref{demt_res} the quantitative comparative analysis of both rotations using DEMT is described and in Section \ref{awsom_res} AWSoM results are related to the one of DEMT. Finally in Section \ref{discu} summarizes and discusses the main conclusions of this analysis, and anticipates further planned work.

In DEMT, the low corona in the height range $1.0-1.25\,\mrsun$ is discretized in a spherical computational grid. The size of the tomographic grid cell (or voxel) is typically set to 0.01 \rsun \ in the radial direction and 2\deg\ in both the latitudinal and longitudinal directions. The cadence of the data time-series is set to 6\,hr. The main product of the technique is the local DEM (LDEM) at each volxel, a measure of the temperature distribution of the plasma contained in it. 


\citet{maccormack_2017} developed a new DEMT product concerning the energetics of the inner solar corona.}

\section{Methodology}\label{meto}   

\subsection{{DEMT Reconstructions}}\label{demt}

{We carried out the 3D DEMT reconstruction and MHD modeling of two target Carrington rotations (CR). We selected CR-2082 (2009, 05 April through 03 May), a deep minimum rotation between solar cycles (SC) 23 and 24, and CR-2208 (2018, 02 September through 29 September), a rotation during the early declining fase of SC 24. To study CR-2082 and CR-2208 data taken by the STEREO/EUVI-B and SDO/AIA instruments was used, respectively. The EUVI and AIA data were prepared using the latest processing tools and calibration corrections provided by their teams through the SolarSoft package. For this work, we introduced two improvements in the implementation of the DEMT technique, as described next.}

{While in all previous DEMT studies full-disk data was used to perform tomography, in this work we opted to only use off-limb data. In this way, the smallest scale and brighter coronal features seen on disk (most typically in the 171\AA\ band) are not included. This has two implications. Fistly, the fast dynamics that typically characterizes those structures is abscent from the data. Sencondly, only half synodic rotation worth of data is needed to constrain the inversion problem for the whole coronal volume. As a result, coronal dynamics induced artifacts are reduced compared to previous DEMT reconstructions.}
.
{The solution of the tomographic problem involves a very large sparse matrix. Such type of inversion problems are characterized by spurious high-frequency artifacts in the solution, which can be mitigated through \emph{regularization} techniques \citep{frazin_2000}. In the case of DEMT, all previous efforts used the 2D scheme implemented by \citet{frazin_2009}, using a finite difference matrix operator to approximate angular derivatives in both latitude and longitude. Also new to the present work, is the implementation of an expanded 3D regularization scheme, which adds to the previous scheme a finite difference matrix operator to approximate radial derivatives. In this way, the tomographic inversion problem is performed penalizing nonphysical high-frequency artifacts in all three spatial directions. As a result, tomographic reconstructions behave more smoothly close to the radial boundaries of the computational grid when compared to previous reconstructions.}

{We summarize next the main aspects of DEMT required for the analysis of this work. We refer the reader to \citet{frazin_2009} for a full description of the technique.}

In a first step, the time series of EUV images is used to solve a solar rotational tomography (SRT) problem, for each EUV band independently. As a result, the 3D distribution of the so called \emph{filter band emissivity} (FBE) is determined for each band separately. The FBE, {an emissivity-type quantity}, is defined as the wavelength integral of the coronal EUV spectral emissivity and the telescope's passband function of each EUV channel. Line-of-sight (LOS) integration of the FBE provides synthetic images that can be quantitatively compared to the real data in the time series. To find the FBE, the tomographic problem is posed a global optimization problem in which the quadratic norm of the difference between all {pairs of synthetic and real images is minimized.}

{In a second step, the FBE values obtained for all bands in each voxel {of the tomographic grid are used to constrain the determination of the LDEM which, as described in Section \ref{intro}, describes the temperature distribution of the plasma within the individual voxel.} Specifically, at each tomographic voxel $i$, the FBE of the band $k$ is related to the LDEM of the voxel according to}

\begin{equation}\label{fbeldem}
\FBE_i^{(k)}  = \int\,\textrm{d}T\,\LDEM_i(T)\,{\TRF}^{(k)}(T), \ \ \ {k=1,...,K}
\end{equation}

\noindent
{where $K$ is the number EUV bands, and $\TRF^{(k)}$ is the \emph{temperature response function} of the $j$-th detector. The TRFs are here computed based on the (known) channel’s passband times the coronal emissivity at that temperature (normalized by the squared electron density). The emissivity model used here is provided by the latest version of the CHIANTI atomic database and plasma emission model \citep{delzanna_2015,landi_2013}.}

Due to unresolved coronal dynamics, tomographic reconstructions exhibit negative values of the reconstructed FBE, or zero when the solution is constrained to positive values \citep{frazin_2000,frazin_2009}. These non-reconstructed voxels are indicated {in black color in the latitude-longitude (Carrington) maps of DEMT} reults in Section \ref{resu}.

{In this work,} data from thre EUV bands was {used:} 171, 193 and 211 \AA \ in {the} case of AIA, and 171, 195 and 284 \AA \ bands in {the} case of EUVI. When using data from {three bands}, a Gaussian model for the LDEM is able to accurately predict the tomographic emissivities \citep{frazin_2009,nuevo_2015}. In each tomographic voxel the problem is then reduced to finding the values of the three free parameters of the Gaussian (centroid, standard deviation, and area) that allow to best reproduce the three tomographically reconstructed values of FBE in that voxel.

Once the LDEM is determined at each voxel, {the LDEM-averaged squared electron density $\Nm^2$ and electron temperature $\Tm$} in the voxel can be computed by taking its zeroth and first moments over temperature. More specifically, at the $i$-th voxel,
{
\begin{eqnarray}\label{momento1}
 \Nsqmi = \langle \Ne^2 \rangle_i &=& \int\,\textrm{d}T\,\LDEM_i(T),\label{Ne} \\ 
\label{momento2}
 \Tmi  = \langle \Te \rangle_i &=& \frac{1}{\langle \Ne^2 \rangle_i}\,\int\,\textrm{d}T\,T\,\LDEM_i(T).\label{Tm} 
\end{eqnarray}
}

We define next a measure of the accuracy of the LDEM model to predict the tomographic FBEs in each voxel, as

\begin{equation}\label{R}
R_i \, \equiv \ (1/K) \, \sum_{k=1}^K \left| \, 1 - \FBE^{(k)}_{i,\rm syn}\,/\,\FBE^{(k)}_{i,\rm tom}\, \right| \,,
\end{equation}

\noindent 
{being the} average relative difference between the tomographic and the synthetic FBEs. {The final product of DEMT is in the form of 3D maps of the LDEM-averaged quantities $\sqravgN$ and $\Tm$, as well as of the measure $R$.}

\subsection{{AWSoM Simulations}}\label{awsom} 

\noindent\notebyalbert{This section will summarize the AWSoM model. Chip, Nishtha, do you think you could provide 2 or 3 paragraphs? We believe the points to cover are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Data input. Link with the data input for DEMT in terms of dates, etc. One paragraph.
  \item Main physical and technical aspects (grid in particular) of the model.  One paragraph. 
  \item Explain the artificially extended TR. One paragraph.
  \item What are the products of the model we care about in this paper ($N_e$, $T_e$, $B$, $V$, as of now). One paragraph.
\end{itemize}
}

In the transition region {(TR)}, the plasma heats up and becomes less dense {by} several orders of magnitude {over} a short distance. Modeling this region {realistically has a very high computational cost}. For this {reason,} the model uses {an artificially} extended {TR about $\approx 0.05\,\mrsun$ thick, as well as artificially large values for the electronic density and temperature as boundary conditions in $r=1\,\mrsun$.} Consequently, model results below {$\approx 1.05\,\mrsun$} were not taken into account in this article.

\subsection{{Tracing Results Along Magnetic Fieldlines}}\label{trace} 

{To determine} the electron density and temperature along individual magnetic field lines, first both the thermodynamic results and the magnetic field obtained with the AWSoM model were interpolated into the DEMT grid. Then, the geometry of the field lines is determined by numerical integration of the first order differential equations  ${\rm d}r/B_r = r{\rm d}\theta/B_\theta = r\,\sin(\theta)\,{\rm d}\phi/B_\phi$, both inwards and outwards, from the specified 3D coordinates of a starting point. In order to evenly sample the whole volume spanned by the DEMT reconstructions, one starting point is selected at the center of each tomographic cell at 6 uniformly spaced heights, ranging from $1.025$ to $1.225\,\mrsun$, and every 2$^\circ$ in both latitude and longitude, for a total of $96,000$ starting points. 

{For analysis purposes, {the traced magnetic field lines are classified as open or closed according to their full geometry. Each closed field} line is further classified as ``small" or ``large", according to its coronal length $L$ being {respectively smaller or larger than the median value of the whole population, which is ${\rm Md}(L)\approx 0.5\,\mrsun$ for both rotations.} Finally, each closed magnetic field line is separated in its two ``legs", defined as the two segments that go from each of its two footpoints (i.e. their location at $r=1\,\mrsun$) to its apex (i.e., the location of maximum height).}

At this {stage, DEMT and AWSoM products} can be traced along open and closed magnetic field lines. Once the field line geometry is computed in high spatial resolution, only one sample point per tomographic cell is kept (the median one). To each sample point, the results corresponding to the tomographic voxel where it is located are assigned to it. As a result, for each field line one data point per tomographic cell {is obtained. This approach} was firstly used by \citet{huang_2012} to {study temperature} structures in the solar minimum {corona and by} \citet{nuevo_2013} to expand that analysis to rotations with different level of activity.

For each open field line and {for each closed field leg}, an exponential fit {was applied} to the electron density {data points} and a linear fit applied to the electron temperature {data points}. For {the DEMT model} the data points used were $\sqravgN(r)$ and $\Tm(r)$, and in case of {the AWSoM models} the data points used were $\Ne(r)$ and $\Te(r)$. The exponential and linear fit equations are described by

\begin{eqnarray}\label{Nfit}
\sqravgN &=& N_0\,\exp{\left[\,-\,\left(h/\l\right)\,/\,\left(r/\mrsun\right)\,\right]}\\
\label{Tfit}
\Tm &=& T_0\,+\,m\,h
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent
where $h \equiv r - 1\,\mrsun$ is the coronal height measured from the photosphere. In the electron density fit, $\l\,[\mrsun]$ is the density scale height and $N_0\,[\cminvc]$ is the electron density at the footpoint ($h=0$) of the loop. In the electron temperature fit, $m\,[\MK/\mrsun]$ is the slope and $T_0\,[\MK]$ is the electron temperature at the footpoint of the loop. The slope $m$ is the radial gradient of the electron temperature along the loop, which we denote as $m = \dr\Tm$ hereafter, being $\dr\equiv\er\cdot\nabla$ the radial derivative operator, where $\er$ is the heliocentric radial unit vector.

In the case of the electron density, the fitted function corresponds to the isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium solution, allowing for variation of the solar gravitational acceleration with height. This choice of function provides a straightforward means to directly evaluate how compatible is the observed coronal thermodynamical state with the hydrostatic solution.

{Coronal magnetic structures for which temperature increases/decreases with height (in the inner corona) were dubbed as “up”/“down” loops by \citet{huang_2012} and \citet{nuevo_2013}, who first reported their presence by means of DEMT studies. As speculated by the authors of those works, loops of type down can be expected if the heating deposition is strongly confined near the coronal base of a magnetic loop. Down loops were first predicted by \citet{serio_1981}, and later on by \citet{aschwanden_2002}. In a recent study, \citet{schiff_2016} reproduced both down and up loops by means of numerical simulations, using a 1D steady-state model and {considering time-averaged heating rates.}}

{To determine if the leg of a traced field line is} of type up or down, we first determine the Pearson correlation coefficient $\rhoTr$ between the DEMT temperature $\Tm$ and the heliocentric height $r$ data points. We then select field lines for which the temperature {is significantly correlated with height} by requiring $|\rhoTr| > 0.5$. {To test the goodness of the fit to the temperature-height data we perform a chi-squared test \citep{recipes} considering the uncertainty of the DEMT data points, selecting legs for which the fit matches the data with a 90\% confidence level.} In this way, legs for which the DEMT temperature does not show a significant {correlation} with height, or the linear fit to temperature is {not} good enough, are {excluded from the} analysis. {The test is also applied to the density-height data points, to ensure the trend is reasonably represented by the exponential fit.} Finally, selected legs are then classified as up or down according to if $\dr\Tm > 0$ or $\dr\Tm < 0$, respectively. The linear fit allows characterization of the variation of $\Tm$ with height by means of a characteristic temperature gradient $\dr \Tm\,[\MK/\mrsun]$ along each leg. {The chi-squared test to evaluate the quality of the fits considers the uncertainty level in the DEMT products due to systematic sources (radiometric calibration and tomographic regularization), that \citet{lloveras_2017} estimated to be $\Delta\Tm\approx 10\%$ and $\Delta\sqravgN\approx 5\%$.} In summary, to be selected a leg must meet all three following conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
The leg must go through at least five tomographic grid cells with reconstructed data, and there must be at least one data point in each third of the range of heights spanned by the leg. {This requirement is set to ensure a reasonably spread sample of heights along the leg.}
\item 
The {DEMT temperature and height data points must meet} $|\rhoTr| > 0.5$.
\item 
{The condifence level of both the exponential and linear fits must be larger than 90\%.} 
\end{enumerate}

{To characterize the global thermodynamic state of the inner solar corona in distinct magnetic structures, the DEMT and AWSoM results were traced along the magnetic field lines of the latter model. Based on the geometry and size of the loops, as well as on their thermodynamical properties, their legs were classified in four different types in this work:} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Type 0: closed-small-down with footpoints in the range $|{\rm latitude}|<50\mdeg$. 
\item Type I: closed-small-up with footpoints in the range $|{\rm latitude}|<50\mdeg$. 
\item Type II: closed-large-up with footpoints in the range $|{\rm latitude}|>40\mdeg$. 
\item Type III: open with footpoint in the range $|{\rm latitude}|>60\mdeg$.

{Legs of type down turn out to have a significant population only for closed-small loops. In the case of closed-large loops and open field lines, there are very few cases of type down. Hence, the requirement of being up for legs of type II and III is included above to select the vastly dominating population in each case}. \\
In Section \ref{resu}, the results of both the DEMT and AWSoM models in the distinct magnetic strucures are statistically analysed. {As shown in Section \ref{demt_res}, classification of legs from type 0 through II allows studying the streamer belt in three distinct, progressively outer layers.}

\subsection{{Energy Input Flux}}\label{energia} 

{The high temperature of the corona requires heating mechanisms to compensate for the the losses. While the vast majority of the existing literature on coronal heating focuses on ARs, some studies have been dedicated to the heating of quiet-Sun regions. In particular,  \citet{maccormack_2017} developed a new application of the DEMT technique to estimate the energy input flux required at the base of quiet-Sun coronal loops to mantain them stable. The technique is based on tracing the DEMT results along field lines of a global coronal magnetic model, just as described in the previous Section \ref{trace}.}

{Consider} a simple energy balance for each magnetic flux tube, {in which the dominating losses of} radiative power ($E_r$) and thermal conduction power ($E_c$) are compensated {by a} coronal heating power($E_h$) \citep{aschwanden_2004}:

\begin{equation}\label{Balance}
E_h(s) = E_r(s)+ E_c(s),
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $s$ is the position along {the flux tube} and the {power quntities} are in units of $[{\rm erg\,sec^{-1}\,cm^{-3}}]$.

{The thermal conduction power $E_c$ equals the divergence of the conductive heat flux $F_c$, i.e. $E_c(s)=[1/A(s)]\,{\rm d}[A(s)\,F_c(s)]/{\rm d}s$, where $A(s)$ is the transversal area of the magnetic flux tube at position $s$. Under a quiescent solar corona plasma regime, the conductive flux is assumed to be dominated by the electron thermal conduction, described by the usual Spitzer model \citep{spitzer_1962}

\begin{equation}\label{Fc}
F_c(s)=-\kappa_0\,{T(s)}^{5/2}\,\frac{dT}{ds}(s),
\end{equation}
where $\kappa_0 = 9.2 \times 10^{-7}  {\rm erg\,sec^{-1}\,K^{-7/2}}$ is the Spitzer thermal conductivity.}

Radiative power depends on the amount of plasma in certain temperatures that can radiate. The model estimate it by integrating the squared density multiplied by a radiative loss function $\Lambda(T)$. This function depends on plasma temperature and is calculated by the atomic database and the plasma emission model from CHIANTI \citep{delzanna_2015}. Then, the expression for radiative power obtained is:

\begin{equation}\label{Er}
E_r = \int\,\textrm{d}T\,\LDEM(T)\,\Lambda(T)
\end{equation}

{The energy balance given by Equation (\ref{Balance}) is then integrated in the volume of any given coronal magnetic flux tube. Dividing the result by the flux tube area at the coronal base, and making use of the soleidonal conditon of the magnetic field, a field-line integrated version of that energy balance is found,
\begin{equation}\label{FluxBalance}
\phi_h = \phi_r + \phi_c,
\end{equation}
\noindent
where the line integrated flux quantities $\phi_{r,c}\,[\rm{erg\,sec^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}]$ are given by \citep{maccormack_2017},} \\


\begin{equation}\label{phi_r}
\phi_r = \left( \frac{B_0 \ B_L}{B_0 + B_L} \right) \int_{0}^{L} ds \ \frac{E_r(s)}{B(s)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{phi_c}
\phi_c = \left( \frac{B_0 \ F_{c,L} - B_L \ F_{c,0}}{B_0 + B_L} \right) 
\end{equation}

{Note that, for any given field line, all quantities in these two expresions can be computed from the DEMT and AWSoM models through Equations \ref{Fc}-\ref{Er}. Once computed, the quantity $\phi_h$ can be calculated, which is the energy input flux required at the coronal base of each coronal field-line to mantain a stable coronal structure.}

\section{Results}\label{resu} 

\subsection{Tomographic Results}\label{demt_res} 

{As described in Section \ref{demt}, we carried out DEMT reconstructions of the coronal structure for target rotations CR-2082 and CR-2208 using STEREO/EUVI and SDO/AIA data, respectively.} {Once the LDEM was determined for each rotation, the square root of the mean value of the electron density squared ($\sqravgN$) and the electron mean temperature ($\Tm$) were computed at each voxel of the tomographic computational grid by means of Equations \ref{momento1} and \ref{momento2}{, and the measure $R$ was calculated by means of Equation \ref{R}.}} 

{As an example,} Figures \ref{carmaps_demt_2082} and \ref{carmaps_demt_2208} show {latitude-longitude} maps of DEMT results for both {rotations. Three different heights {of interest are selected from the tomographic grid}, providing also a detailed 3D view of the tomographic results: the lowest height of {the} tomographic grid ($1.025\,\mrsun$), {the lowest height where the AWSoM results are fully} consistent with coronal conditions ($1.065\,\mrsun$), and a middle height of the tomographic grid ($1.105\mrsun$)}. Black voxels correspond to non-reconstructed voxels ({see} Section \ref{demt}). Thick-black {curves indicate} the {open/closed boundaries of the magnetic field of the} AWSoM model.

{Both target rotations are highly axisymmetric, i.e. characterized by a high azymuthal symmetry. Rotation CR-2082} showed two {small} active regions (ARs), both near latitude $+30\mdeg$ and {around longitudes} $50\mdeg$ and $120\mdeg${, respectively}. {Rotation CR-2208} showed two {ARs, both near latitude} $+5\mdeg$ and {around longitudes $140\mdeg$ and $300\mdeg$, respectively.} 

{The magnetically open and closed regions of the AWSoM model are associated to Coronal holes (CHs) and the equatorial streamer belt, respectively. Consistently with that, the {location of the} open/closed boundaries derived from the respective AWSoM model quite accurately matchs {the regions of the DEMT maps which exhibit the strongest latitudinal gradient of both the electron density and temperature.}}

{{Figures \ref{carmaps_demt_2082} and \ref{carmaps_demt_2208} show that} the DEMT reconstruction of the streamer belt is characterized by relatively larger values of density and temperature in comparison to the CHs. They also show that the streamer belt region of CR-2082 was denser and colder than  that of CR-2208.} In the case of CR-2082, which belongs to the deep minimum epoch between {SCs 24 and 25}, the {low latitudes of the streamer belt are characterized by lower electron temperature than in its mid-latitudes.} A similar behavior is seen in CR-2208, belonging to the declining phase of {SC 25, but having a {somewhat less axisymmetric} structure this characteristic is not so obvious. This thermodynamic structure} of the streamer have been reported for other solar minimum rotations in previous DEMT works \citep{lloveras_2017,nuevo_2013,vasquez_2010}.

{For both target rotations, Figure \ref{carmaps_R_2082_2208} shows {latitude-longitude} maps of {the DEMT} measure $R$ defined by Equation (\ref{R}), at the same three heights shown in Figures \ref{momento1} and \ref{momento2}. In most of the coronal volume of the DEMT grid the agreement between the tomographic and synthetic FBEs is $\lesssim 1\%$. The notable exception is to be found in the CHs of the target rotation {analysed} based on AIA data. A similar results was found in the two existing DEMT works based on data provided by the AIA instrument \citep{nuevo_2015,maccormack_2017}. This point is further discussed below.}

{To characterize the DEMT results in different magnetic structures, we traced} $\sqravgN$ and $\Tm$ along the magnetic field lines of the AWSoM model. For both rotations, all legss that meet the criteria listed in Section \ref{trace} were selected. For each leg, the data points of electron density and electron mean temperature as a function of height were fitted to the Equations \ref{Nfit} and \ref{Tfit}. {As a result, the electron density $N_0(r=1.0\,\mrsun)$ and scale height $\lN$ were computed for each leg, as well as the temperature gradient $\dr\Tm$, and the height-averaged (along the leg) {electron temperature} $\aTm$.}

{For both target rotations, the top panels of Figure \ref{rpoint_demt} show the latitude-longitude location (at heliocentric height $r=1.105\,\mrsun$) of all traced field line legs for which criterion (i) of Section \ref{trace} is met. Open legs are indicated in gray color and closed ones in black color. For each leg, the fits to tomografic temperature and density were applied, as given by Equations (\ref{Nfit})-(\ref{Tfit}). Considering the DEMT data points and the resulting fits along each leg, the bottom panels of Figure \ref{rpoint_demt} show the latitude-longitude location of the subset for which also both criteria (ii) and (iii) of Section \ref{trace} are met. Using a four-color code, type 0, I, II and III legs are shown in blue, red, {magenta and cyan} color, respectively.} Of the {$\approx 44000$} legs selected for CR-2082, 20\% are type 0, 31\% are type I, 23\% are type II and 26\% type III. On the other hand, of the {$\approx 44000$} legs selected for CR-2208, 10\% are type 0, 43\% are type I, 30\% are type II and 17\% type III.

{Type 0 (small down) legs mainly populate the equatorial latitudes. This kind of structure was originally found by \citet{huang_2012}, and their existence was shown to be anti-correlated with the solar activity level {around the solar minimum between SCs 24 and 25} by \citet{nuevo_2013}. Later on, \citet{lloveras_2017} showed {that} equatorial down loops in streamers were also to be found in the deep minimum between SCs {23 and 24}. Here, we verify the existence of this type of structure for the two target rotations. The relatively smaller population of down legs seen in CR-2208, as compared to CR-2082, is consistent with the aforementioned results by \citet{nuevo_2013}. Type I (small up) mainly populate the mid-latitudes, while type II (large up) legs are mostly very large trans-equatorial field lines forming the envelope of the streamer belt. Finally, type III (open) legs populate the CHs.}

\end{center}
\end{figure} 

Figure \ref{gradt_demt} shows frequency histograms {of $\dr\Tm$} for legs of type 0, I, II and III. The lack of population around values close to zero is due to the requirement $|\rhoTr| > 0.5$ which discards quasi-isothermal legs. For both rotations, {the median value of the temperature radial gradient is ${\rm Md}\left(\dr\Tm\right) \approx -2.5$, $+2.3$ and $+2.4\,\MK/\mrsun$} for legs of type 0, I and II, respectively.

{The notable difference between both rotations is the characteristic {value ${\rm Md}\left(\dr\Tm\right)\approx +4.5\,\MK/\mrsun$} for legs of type III for CR-2208. This is related to the much larger $R$ score for the DEMT results along CH legs for CR-2208. In this case, DEMT performs poorly in modeling a LDEM that predicts the tomographic FBEs with reasonable accuracy. Indeed, visual inspection of the DEMT temperature maps for CR-2208 in Figure \ref{momento2}, {reveals that in most of the CH region the result for $\Tm$ below height $1.105\,\mrsun$ is quite uniform and artificially low}. As it turns out, around and above height this height the score $R$ is lower and the temperature results are more reliable. As a result, the temperature gradient along these legs is artificially larger, with the linear fit trying to simultaneously fit the artificially low values of $\Tm$ at lower heights. In general, the DEMT results in the CH region based on AIA data are thus much less reliable than in the rest of the analysis. We will return to this point in the conclusion section.}

{Throughout the magnetically closed region of both rotations, type 0, I and II legs, associated to  increasingly outer layers of the equatorial streamer belt, exhibit progressively decreasing coronal base density, increasing density scale height, and increasing electron temperature. In both rotations also, type III legs in the CHs are characterized by sub-MK temperatures, and electron density values of order $\approx 1/2$ of those observed for the type 0 and type I legs in the core of the equatorial streamer.}

{A comparison of the results between the two rotations shows that, compared to CR-2082, target rotation CR-2208 was characterized by {$\approx 10-20\%$} lower values of the electron density at the coronal base, $\approx 5-30\%$ larger values of density scale height, and {$\approx 5-25\%$} larger values of the electron temperature.} 

{To analyze the loop-integrated energy flux quantities introduced in Section \ref{trace}, we selected closed loops for which both legs have the same sign of the radial gradient of the electron temperature $\dr\Tm$.} In this way, according to the classification of both its legs, each given loop was classified as of type 0 (small down loop), I (small up loop), or II (large up loop). {For both target rotations, and for loops of type 0, I and II, Figure \ref{energia_demt} shows the frequency histogram of the loop-integrated energy flux quantities {$\phi_r$, $\phi_c$ and $\phi_h$ in blue, green and red color}, respectively.}

\end{figure} 

{For both rotations, the value of the {loop-integrated} radiative power $E_r$, measured by the quantity $\phi_r$, is largest for loops of type 0. This is due to $E_r\propto N_e^2\,\Lambda(T_e)$, with both factors contributing to maximize $E_r$ for loops of type 0. As shown in Figure \ref{histos_fulldemt} and Table \ref{tabla_demt}, loops of type 0 are characterized by {the largest} values of electron density. Also, in the range of sensitivity of the EUVI and AIA instruments, namely 0.5–3.0 MK \citep{nuevo_2015}, the radiative loss function $\Lambda(T)$ has a local maximum at $\Tc\approx 1\,\MK$. According to Figure \ref{histos_fulldemt}, loops of type 0, I and II are characterized by {values of temperature that are progressively larger and farther} from the value $\Tc$, for both rotations.}

{{The sign of the quantity $\phi_c$ depends on that of the conductive flux $F_c$. Equations (\ref{Fc}) and (\ref{phi_c}) imply that } down loops (type 0) and up loops (type I and II) are characterized by $\phi_c<0$ and $\phi_c>0$, respectively, {as verified} in Figure \ref{energia_demt}.}

{{Adding the} radiative and conductive terms, the characteristic energy input flux at the coronal base is in the range $\phi_h\approx 0.5-1.5 \times 10^5\,\erg\,\cminvs\,\s^{-1}$, depending on the rotation and the type of {loop, matching the values reported by} \citet{maccormack_2017}. Note that for type 0 loops there is a marginal population characterized by the unphysical result $\phi_h<0$. As shown by \citet{maccormack_2017}, {this affects only the smallest sized loops of the type 0}, and it is {most probably} due to the limited temperature sensitivity of the instrumental passbands. The radiative loss term is {here calculated based on plasma emission detected by three coronal bands of EUVI or AIA. Though accounting for most of the coronal plasma, there surely is additional emission out of the instrumental sensitivity range. As a result,} the positive term $\phi_r$ is most likely underestimated, leading to values $\phi_h<0$ in loops of type 0, {being characterized by $\phi_c<0$.}}

\subsection{{Comparison of the DEMT and AWSoM Models}}\label{awsom_res} 

{For both target rotations,} Figures \ref{carmaps_awsom_2082} and \ref{carmaps_awsom_2208} show latitude-longitude maps of the AWSoM electron density and temperature. {Maps are shown} at the same three heights selected for visualization of the DEMT results in Figures \ref{carmaps_demt_2082} and \ref{carmaps_demt_2208}. {Thick-black curves} indicate the magnetic open/closed boundaries based on the magnetic field of the AWSoM model. Visual inspection of these maps shows that the AWSoM model for both rotations is highly {axisymetric}, as the tomographic model.

{As described in Section \ref{awsom}, the AWSoM model includes an artificially thick TR, achieving coronal conditions above height $\approx 1.06\,\mrsun$. Indeed, the top panels in Figures \ref{carmaps_awsom_2082} and \ref{carmaps_awsom_2208}, at height $1.025\,\mrsun$, clearly do not represent coronal conditions (although we include them here for completeness). When compared to DEMT results (Figures \ref{carmaps_demt_2082} and \ref{carmaps_demt_2208}), the latitude-longitude maps of the AWSoM model for heights $1.065$ and $1.105\,\mrsun$ capture well the denser and hotter equatorial streamer belt surrounded by the less dense and colder CHs. Furthermore, for both target rotations, the temperature maps show the low latitudes of the equatorial streamer belt to be characterized by lower temperatures than its mid-latitudes, as also seen in the DEMT results. The latitude-longitude maps of the AWSoM and DEMT results are shown in the same units and scales, so that a visual comparison among them already reveals similar values of electron density and temperature in both models.}

{Being highly axisymmtric target rotations, the longitude-averaged latitudinal variation of the results of both models is an informative way to compare their large-scale structure. Such comparison is shown in Figure \ref{perf_lat} at height $1.105\,\mrsun$, with top panels comparing electron density and lower panels electron temperature. In these longitude-averaged profiles, longitudes containing ARs or low latitude CHs were excluded. In each panel the averaged latitudinal variation for the DEMT model is shown in solid-line style, while the result for the AWSoM model is shown in dashed-linesyle.

{Several details from Figure \ref{perf_lat} are worth being highlighted. Firstly, for CR-2082 the electron density of both models agree within $\approx 20\%$ at all latitudes, and for CR-2208 the agreement is within $\approx5\%$. In the case of the electron temperature both models agree within $\approx 10-15\%$ at all latitudes for both target rotations. Secondly, for both target rotations, and for both models, these plots clearly show the relatively lower temperatures characterising the low-latitudes of the equatorial streamer belt compared to its mid-latitudes. Thirdly, for both target rotations, the latitude of the open/closed magnetic boundary in both hemispheres matches the location of the strongest latitudinal gradient of the DEMT electron density. Note this is not the case for the AWSoM model, that shows a minimum density at the open/closed boundary. Last, note that the DEMT electron density decreases from the open/closed boundary towards the poles (in both hemispheres of the two target rotations), while the AWSoM model shows the opposite trend.}

To characterize the results of the AWSoM model in distinct magnetic structures, its results for electron density and temperature were traced along its magnetic field lines. For each field line leg, the results were then fit to Equations (\ref{Nfit}) and (\ref{Tfit}){, considering only data points above heliocentric height $1.055\,\mrsun$. We then classified the traced legs into types I, II and III, according to the criteria described in Section \ref{trace}.  Legs of type 0 are not included for AWSoM, as in its current implementation it can not simulate down loops, a point we will discuss in the next section.}

{For both target rotations, the top panels of Figure \ref{rpoint_awsom} show the latitude-longitude location (at heliocentric height $1.105\,\mrsun$) of all traced field line legs for which criterion (i) of Section \ref{trace} is met. That criterion is adapted here, requiring that at least five voxels of the tomographic grid are threaded by the leg. Open legs are indicated in gray color and closed ones in black color. For each leg, the fits to tomografic temperature and density were applied, as given by Equations \ref{Nfit} and \ref{Tfit}. Considering the AWSoM data points and the resulting fits along each leg, the bottom panels of Figure \ref{rpoint_awsom} show the latitude-longitude location of the subset for which also both criteria (ii) and (iii) of Section \ref{trace} are met. Using a three-color code, type I, II and III legs are shown in red, magenta and cyan color, respectively. This figure is to be compared with the corresponding Figure \ref{rpoint_demt} for DEMT results. It is readily seen that the AWSoM maps are more populated than those of DEMT. This is due to the 3D MHD model having electron density and temperature fields spatially smoother than those of DEMT.}

{As discussed above, Figure \ref{perf_lat} shows that the logitude-averaged latitudinal profile of the DEMT electron density in the CHs decreases towards the poles. Figure \ref{perf_lon_vr} below shows the longitude-averaged AWSoM radial wind speed $V_r$ at $6\,\mrsun$, where all field lines are open. The heliocentric current sheet (HCS) location is indicated by the minimum of the speed curve. For each rotation, all velocity data points to the south of the HCS position map down to the southern CH in Figures \ref{perf_lat}. Similarly, all velocity data points to the north of the HCS position map down to the northern CH in Figures \ref{perf_lat}. This clearly shows an anti-correlation between the DEMT electron density at low heights and the AWSoM wind speed at larger heights.}

\notebyalbert{We could quantify the anti-correlation between the AWSoM terminal speed and the DEMT electron density at the coronal base in the following fashion. We can set up starting points at, say, $20\,\mrsun$, every one degree, both in latitude and longitude. This would mean setting up $180\times 360$ starting points. We trace then the (open) field lines from each of those starting points down to $1.0\,\mrsun$ to find out the DEMT results at those lower heights for each field line. Now, to do this we need to develop some codes and have no time for this paper. We can postpone it for a next effort, or... Chip: do you think you could do this with your present tools? Do you think it is interesting? I think so. Our submission deadline is 24 January.}

I believe it is interesting to compare these two curves with Figure 10. Note that while in this Figure all latitudes are magnetically open, in Figure 10 only the part at latitudes larger than the vertical black lines are open. Note that DEMT shows that in the open low corona $N_e$ decreases from the O/C boundary towards the poles, anti-correlating with the AWSoM terminal speed, which is nice. In order to quantify this anti-correlation we need to trace the terminal speed and the DEMT $N_e$, which we may need to do with the help of Chip and Nishtha. Chip, we can discuss this idea over Skype after Xmas if you are around.}}

\section{{Discussion and Conclusions}}\label{discu} 

{We carried out the 3D DEMT reconstruction and MHD modeling of the inner solar corona for two target rotations, CR-2082 and CR-2208. The first target belongs to the deep minimum epoch between SCs 23 and 24, while the latter belongs to the end of the declining phase of SC 24. The present work introduces two improvements in the implementation of DEMT, namely the use of only off-limb data in the EUV images, and the inclusion of a 3D regularization scheme. As a result of the former, artifacts introduced by coronal dynamics are mitigated, and as a result of the latter, tomographic reconstructions behave more smoothly close to the radial boundaries of the computational grid when compared to previous reconstructions. The MHD model used is here the latest version of the AWSoM component of the SWMF suite.}

{Based on the magnetic field model of AWSoM model and the results of the DEMT model for electron density and temperature, we classified coronal structures in four different types. Smaller legs in the core of the streamer belt are classified in down/up types according to their temperature decreasing/increasing with height (dubbed type 0/I). Larger closed legs of type up that form the envelope of the streamer belt (dubbed type II), and open field lines of type up populating the CHs (dubbed type III).}

Concerning the DEMT reconstructions, Figure \ref{rpoint_demt} shows that, for both target rotations, magnetic field lines of type 0, I and II are associated to increasingly outer {layers} of the equatorial streamer belt. Figure \ref{histos_fulldemt} and Table \ref{tabla_demt} report in 3D quantitative detail how these progressively outer magnetic structures exhibit progressively decreasing coronal base density, increasing density scale height, and increasing electron temperature. For both target rotations we find that down legs populate the low latitudes of the streamer belt, while up legs dominate its mid-latitudes. Also, in the case of CR-2082 the fraction of down legs is significantly larger than for CR-2208. These findings are consistent with previous studies by \citet{huang_2012} and \citet{nuevo_2013}. In the case of the latter, they include in their analysis target CR-2081, which is a rotation almost identical to our target CR-2082. Our results for target CR-2082 compare very well with those of \citet{nuevo_2015} and \citet{lloveras_2017} for target CR-2081. As our study uses the improved version of the DEMT technique, such comparison provided a consistency check for the changes implemented in the DEMT technique.



{{For both target rotations}, type III field lines in the CHs are characterized by sub-MK temperatures, and electron density values of order $\approx 1/2$ of those observed for the type 0 and type I lines in the core of the equatorial streamer. In the case of the AIA based DEMT reconstruction, we show that in a substantial fraction of the CHs region the technique performs poorly in modeling LDEMs that predict the tomographic emissivitiy in each EUV band with reasonable accuracy. As a result, DEMT results based on AIA data are currently less reliable in the CH region. This was already found by the existing two previous DEMT works based on AIA data \citep{nuevo_2015,maccormack_2017}. The source of this distinct performance of DEMT when applied to EUVI or AIA data is related to the TRFs of the respective filter sets. We are currently implementing an improved LDEM determination algorithm to to deal with this issue that will be used in a follow up article.}

In comparing the DEMT results obtained for the two selected targets, {we highlight here that} they rely on data provided by two different instruments, {namely EUVI and AIA for CR-2082 and CR-2208, respectively.} In order to quantify the systematic difference of the DEMT products based on both instruments, \citet{nuevo_2015}, who were the first to apply DEMT to AIA data, {analysed} a single target using both instruments independently. They found that while the density {products are} essentially equal, the temperature product of DEMT based on AIA data is systematically 8\% larger than the one based on EUVI data, i.e. $\Tm^{\rm(AIA)}/\Tm^{\rm(EUVI)} \approx 1.08$. Considering such correction, Figure \ref{histos_fulldemt} and Table \ref{tabla_demt} indicate that CR-2208 was {characterized by temperatures $\approx 10-15\%$ larger relative to CR-2082} throughout the streamer belt region. As for the electron density products, CR-2208 was found to be $\approx 15-20\%$ less dense than CR-2082 throughout the streamer belt region. These systematic differences are {around or beyond the uncertainty level in the DEMT products due to systematic sources (radiometric calibration and tomographic regularization), that \citet{lloveras_2017} {estimated to be $\Delta\Tm\approx 10\%$ and $\Delta\sqravgN\approx 5\%$}.}

{In the streamer belt region we combined the DEMT results and the AWSoM magnetic model to infer the energy input flux $\phi_h$ at the coronal base required to maintain stable coronal loops. To this end, we applied the technique developed by \citet{maccormack_2017}. We found characteristic values in the range $\phi_h\approx 0.5-1.5 \times 10^5\,\erg\,\cminvs\,\s^{-1}$, depending on the rotation and the type of {loop, matching the values reported by} \citet{maccormack_2017}. Based on spectroscopic data of the EIS instrument in quiet-Sun regions \citet{hahn_2014} showed that, if the observed non-thermal broadening are assigned to Alfvén waves, their energy flux at the coronal base is estimated to be in the range $\approx 1.5-2.5\times 10^5\,\erg\,\cminvs\,\s^{-1}$. A large fraction of the coronal base energy input flux $\phi_h$ estimated in this work, or even its totality, could then be accounted for by Alfvén waves.}

Results of the AWSoM model are compared to those of the DEMT reconstructions in the range of coronal heights $\approx 1.05-1.20\,\mrsun$ simultaneously covered by both models. In its current implementation, the AWSoM model can not reproduce down loops (type 0), so the comparison is restricted to type I, II and III field lines. The detailed comparison shown in this work can be summarized as follows. For CR-2082, the electron density of both models agree within $\approx 20\%$ in all regions, while for CR-2208 the agreement is within $\approx 5\%$. In the case of the electron temperature, both models agree within $\approx 10-15\%$ in all regions, for both target rotations. This level of agreement between both models is considerably better than that reported in previous works. \citet{oran_2015} and \citet{jin_2012} reported electron density values of the AWSoM model {differing by $\approx 50\%$ compared to the DEMT reconstructions, both in the equatorial streamer and CH regions.} \notebyalbert{Chip, if Section 2.2 explains the most significant improvements of AWSoM since the version used in those references, we can comment on the reason for the improvement here.}

{Within the quantitative match summarized in the previous paragraph, there are some qualitative agreements and disagreements between both models worth noticing. For both target rotations, the AWSoM model reproduces the relatively lower temperatures found by DEMT to characterize the low-latitudes of the equatorial streamer belt compared to its mid-latitudes. On the other hand, while the latitude of the open/close magnetic boundary in both hemispheres matches the location of the strongest latitudinal gradient of the DEMT electron density, this is not the case for the AWSoM model, that shows a minimum density at the open/closed boundary. Also, while the DEMT electron density decreases from the open/closed boundary towards the poles (in both hemispheres of the two target rotations), the AWSoM model shows the opposite trend. This behavior is notoriously opposite to that reported in the AWSoM model version used by \citet{oran_2015}, in which the electron density decreases from the open/closed boundary towards the poles.} \notebyalbert{Chip: Even if the match AWSoM/DEMT is quantitatively pretty good, this qualitative opposite behavior is off putting. Do you think there is room for improvement in the AWSoM model here? Maybe worth mentioning?}

\notebyalbert{Chip: In relation to the previous comment, if the analysis proposed in Figure 15 is carried out we should say something about that here.}

A detailed empirical description of the 3D termodynamic structure of the inner corona at a global scale is currently only possible with tomographic techniques, such as DEMT. Using tomographic results for continuous validation of 3D MHD models is of high relevance for the continued improvement of models. In {follow up articles} we will {carry out the 3D DEMT reconstruction and MHD modeling of} new target rotations {selected from} the current solar minimum {epoch} between SCs 24 and 25, {as well as rotation CR-2219 corresponding to the July 2nd 2019 total solar eclipse.}
