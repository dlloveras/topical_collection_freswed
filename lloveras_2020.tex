\begin{abstract}
Observational {techniques} play an essential role in advancing our understanding of the physics of the solar corona. They provide validation data {for} three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the solar atmosphere, {key to improve} their space weather forecasting capabilities. Solar rotational tomography (SRT) is currently the sole observational technique that provides an empirical 3D description of some {of the fundamental} plasma parameters of the solar corona at a global scale. Based on EUV data of space borne instruments, SRT allows constructing 3D maps of the coronal electron density and temperature at heliocentric heights below 1.25 Rsun. We carry out a study of the corona combining tomographic reconstructions with MHD simulations {using} the latest version of the Alfv\'en Wave Solar Model (AWSoM) of the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF). Target rotations were selected from the solar minimum between solar cycles (SC) 23 and 24 and the current declining phase of solar cycle 24. Tomographic reconstructions and results of the model are analyzed in distinct coronal magnetic structures. We study magnetically closed structures associated with the equatorial streamer belt, as well as magnetically open regions enclosing it. We report on the tomographic results in the different structures, their implications for the physics of the solar corona, and the {current} capability of the AWSoM model to reproduce the tomographic reconstructions in different regions.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro} 

Being the place where the solar atmosphere is heated and the solar wind accelerated, and where impulsive events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections are energized, observation and modeling of the solar corona are tasks of great relevance to improve our understanding of the Sun-Earth environment. To advance our knowledge of the physics of the solar corona, as well as to improve its three-dimensional (3D) models, information derived from observational data plays a key role. Solar rotational tomography is currently the sole observational technique able to provide a quantitative empirical description of the 3D distribution of some fundamental plasma parameters of the solar corona at a global scale.

\noindent\notebyalbert{Here we will put in a couple of paragraphs summarizing what SRT and DEMT are, including references and defining the accronyms in the process. We should refer to minima in particular. We should mention the instruments and missions we use as data for DEMT, and define their accronyms too. Also, a couple of paragraphs on the AWSoM model and the SWMF, including references and defining the accronyms in the process.}

\section{Methodology}\label{meto}   

\subsection{DEMT reconstructions}\label{demt}

\noindent\notebyalbert{This section will summarize DEMT's main aspects and equations, only those needed to understand the paper. Nothing not needed to read this paper is provided. Also, no derivation of equations are provided. References are given so that the reader can dig deeper if so desires. Points to cover are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Selected targets, instruments used. One paragraph.
  \item Characteristics of the data (specific time series, dates, bands, etc.), SolarSoft software version used for their processing. One paragraph.
  \item Technical aspects of DEMT (grid, regularization, off-limb data is only used) and how these differ from previous versions (rereferences). One paragraph.
  \item What is FBE, what is LDEM, what is R. Why we care about these three quantities and what is their physical meaning should be clear. Then the final products $\Nm$ and $\Tm$, and what is their physical meaning.
\end{itemize}
}

\begin{equation}\label{fbeldem}
\FBE_i^{(k)}  = \int\,\textrm{d}T\,\LDEM_i(T)\,{\TRF}^{(k)}(T), \ \ \ {k=1,...,K}
\end{equation}

\temp{
Due to unresolved coronal dynamics, tomographic reconstructions exhibit negative values of the reconstructed FBE, or zero when the solution is constrained to positive values \citep{frazin_2000,frazin_2009}. These non-reconstructed voxels are indicated as black voxels in the Carrington maps of the reconstructed DEMT reults in Section \ref{resu}.
}

Once the LDEM is determined at each voxel, the average squared electron density $\langle \Ne^2 \rangle$ and the electron mean temperature $\Tm$ in the voxel can be computed by taking its zeroth and first moments over temperature. More specifically, at the $i$-th voxel,

{
\begin{eqnarray}\label{momento1}
 \Nsqmi = \langle \Ne^2 \rangle_i &=& \int\,\textrm{d}T\,\LDEM_i(T),\label{Ne} \\ 
\label{momento2}
 \Tmi  = \langle \Te \rangle_i &=& \frac{1}{\langle \Ne^2 \rangle_i}\,\int\,\textrm{d}T\,T\,\LDEM_i(T),\label{Tm} 
\end{eqnarray}
}

{We define next a measure of the average relative difference between the tomographic and the synthetic FBE in each voxel, as}

\begin{equation}\label{R}
R_i \, \equiv \ (1/K) \, \sum_{k=1}^K \left| \, 1 - \FBE^{(k)}_{i,\rm syn}\,/\,\FBE^{(k)}_{i,\rm tom}\, \right| \,,
\end{equation}

so that the final product of DEMT is in the form of 3D maps of the electron density and mean temperature. These relationships {were} derived in detail in \citealt{frazin_2009} (see Appendix C).\\
\temp{Aclarar que consideramos Ne como $\sqrt{<\Ne ^2>}$.} {ALBERT: Yo creo que es mejor hablar de $\sqravgN$}

\temp{DEMT has been improved since the previously published work. We now perform hollow-tomography with the EUV images, (definir hollow-tom) and a 3D regularized of the solution was applyed to obtain smother and more reliable result at the edge of the tomographic grid.} \notebyalbert{NOTA de Albert: Explicá que hacés sin justificarte. Luego aclará como se hizo eso en trabajos previos, y cual es el impacto esperado. Puedo proveer un párrafo de ejemplo, pero creo que será mejor que vos escribas como te salga y yo luego edito. Algo muy importante para todo el paper: proponete escribir ``párrafos modulares". Es decir que, con las razonables limitaciones, puedan moverse de lugar, de orden, y sigan funcionando. No definiría hollow-tomography, es un término coloquial interno nuestro. Lo correcto es que al hablar de datos mucho más arribas expliques que los datos del disco no se utilizan, pero no le des un nombre a la tomografía.}

\subsection{AWSoM simulations}\label{awsom} 

\noindent\notebyalbert{This section will summarize the AWSoM model. After a first version is written we will surely require some input from the Michigan friends. Points to cover:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Data input. Link with the data input for DEMT in terms of dates, etc. One paragraph.
  \item Main physical and technical aspects (grid in particular) of the model.  One paragraph. 
  \item Explain the artificially extended TR. One paragraph.
  \item What are the products of the model we care about in this paper. One paragraph.
\end{itemize}
}

In the transition region {(TR)}, the plasma heats up and becomes less dense {by} several orders of magnitude {over} a short distance. Modeling this region {realistically has a very high computational cost}. For this {reason,} the model uses {an artificially} extended {TR about $\approx 0.05\,\mrsun$ thick, as well as artificially large values for the electronic density and temperature as boundary conditions in $r=1\,\mrsun$.} Consequently, model results below {$\approx 1.05\,\mrsun$} were not taken into account in this article.

\subsection{Tracing of results along fieldlines}\label{trace} 

\noindent\notebyalbert{This section will explain how the AWSoM magnetic model is used to trace the thermodynamic products of both DEMT and AWSoM along the fieldlines of AWSoM. This requires covering the following points:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A first paragraph qualitatively describing the process. This includes mentioning that the AWSoM products are first interpolated into the DEMT grid.
  \item A short paragraph describing the numerical method used to trace field lines. We have a nice version of this in your previous paper.  At this point the reader should understand that for each field line we have its geometry $\mathbf{r}(s)$ as a function of the distance $s$ along the loop, with $s(1\,\mrsun)\equiv 0$. 
  \item Explain very simply how then that for each voxel the middle point of the field line is selected and assigned the DEMT and AWSoM products of that cell. At this point the reader should understand that for each field line we have: $Q[r(s)]$, where $Q$ is any given quantity from either the DEMT model (specifically $\sqravgN$ and $\Tm$) or the AWSoM model (specifically $\Ne$ and $\Te$).
  \item Explain fits to the DEMT results  $\sqravgN(r)$, $\Tm(r)$.
  \item Explain then the classification of field lines.
\end{itemize}
} 

For both rotations, the DEMT and AWSoM 3D maps of electron density $\Ne$, electron mean temperature $\Tm$ and electron temperature $\Te$ respectively were traced along the magnetic field lines modeled using AWSoM as described at the end of Section \ref{demt}. In the case of closed loops, results were separated into their two legs, defined as the two segments that go from the coronal base up to the apex.

For each open field line, and for each leg of the closed ones, an exponential fit was then applied to {the $\sqravgN(r)$ data points, and a linear fit applied to the $\Tm(r)$ data points}, as described by


\begin{eqnarray}\label{Nfit}
\sqravgN &=& N_0\,\exp{\left[\,-\,\left(h/\l\right)\,/\,\left(r/\mrsun\right)\,\right]}\\
\label{Tfit}
\Tm &=& T_0\,+\,m\,h
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent
where $h \equiv r - 1\,\mrsun$ is the coronal height measured from the photosphere. In the electron density fit, $\l\,[\mrsun]$ is the density scale height and $N_0\,[\cminvc]$ is the electron density at the footpoint ($h=0$) of the loop. In the electron temperature fit, $m\,[\MK/\mrsun]$ is the slope and $T_0\,[\MK]$ is the electron temperature at the footpoint of the loop. The slope $m$ is the radial gradient of the electron temperature along the loop, which we denote as $m = \dr\Tm$ hereafter, being $\dr\equiv\er\cdot\nabla$ the radial derivative operator, where $\er$ is the heliocentric radial unit vector.

In the case of the electron density, the fitted function corresponds to the isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium solution, allowing for variation of the solar gravitational acceleration with height. This choice of function provides a straightforward means to directly evaluate how compatible is the observed coronal thermodynamical state with the hydrostatic solution.

%La temperatura en funcion de la altura a lo largo de lineas muestra comportamientos lineales. En el presente trabajo nos focalizamos en lineas con temperaturas crecientes y decrecientes en foma lineal. Es decir nos quedamos con aquellas piernas donde el coeficiente de pearson entre la temperatura y la altura (rho) cumple rho mayor 0.5 (con p-value 0.05) y de esta forma se descartan aquellas piernas en las que los resultados DEMT no pueden asegurar un cambio notable de temperatura entre la base y el apice (asi no uso la palabra isotermico y evado ese problema)


%The temperature as a function of height along legs shows linear behaviors. 
In the present work we focus on lines with increasing and decreasing temperatures in linear form. In other words, we selected those legs where the {Pearson correlation coefficient $\rho$ between temperature $T$ and radius $r$ meets $|\rhoTr| > 0.5$}. \temp{(with p-value less than 0.05)}. In this way, those legs in which the DEMT results cannot ensure a noticeable change in temperature between the base and the apex, are discarded.


The linear fit allows characterization of its variation with height by means of a characteristic temperature gradient $\dr \Tm\,[\MK/\mrsun]$ along each leg.
\diego{En realidad esta regresion lineal utiliza de por si los errores, pero luego tmb los uso para el test de hipotesis, quizas vale la pena ponerlo solo ahi.}


To measure how good the quality of the exponential fit to the electron density and the linear fit to the temperature data are, a chi-square merit function was used (see Section 15.2 \citet{recipes}). The errors were estimated in \citet{lloveras_2017}, $0.07$ MK for $\Tm$ and $4.0\,10^6 cm^{-3}$ for $\Ne$ and legs with p-value $>0.005$ were rejected. 


%el p-valor es un concepto estadístico, no veo xq deberia ser explicado. Lo que si, en el paper explicare bien las hipotesis nulas y de esa forma el p-valor queda bien claro.
%El p-valor es una cuantificacion de con cuanta probabilidad de exito estas rechazando o aceptando una hipotesis en particular que se la suele denominar hipotesis nula.
%En este caso, con 95$\%$ de seguridad estas rechazando las piernas que tienen un $pearson_x,y = 0$. Es decir te estarias quedando con aquellas que tienen una dependencia lineal entre x e y.
%En el segundo caso, el test de hipotesis seria sobre la hip nula de que los datos provienen una funcion distribucion donde la recta fiteada de esos datos es el valor esperado de la distribucion. Con lo cual hacerle un test chi cuadrado te da una idea de cuan acertado o no es el ajuste. En este caso la hipotesis nula es que los datos provienen de esa distrib, con lo cual el chi deberia dar bajo y descartas los que dan valores altos con un 95$\%$ de seguridad. Eso es lo que representa el p-valor =0.05 en este caso (el area bajo la funcion distribucion, es decir, probabilidad).

{To be selected a leg must meet all following conditions.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item 
The leg must go through at least five tomographic grid cells with reconstructed data, and there must be at least one data point in each third of the range of heights spanned by the leg.

\item 
The {value of the Pearson correlation coefficient meets $|\rhoTr| > 0.5$.}

\item 
The p-value of both the exponential and linear fit must be less than 0.05.

\end{enumerate}


For the two targeted rotations, DEMT and AWSoM results were traced along the AWSoM field lines, which provides a way to characterize the global thermodynamic state of the inner solar corona and to compare them. To that end four different types of {legs} corresponding with four different types of magnetic structures were selected:
%\temp{Hacer explicacion de los tipos de lineas bien secos, luego en fig 3 hacer notar que implica cada una en cuanto a estructura magnetica}\\

\begin{itemize}
 \item Type 0 - Small (meaning with apex within the DEMT range of heights) closed field lines in the latitudes range $[-30\mdeg,+30\mdeg]$ and $\dr \Tm < 0$. %This class thoroughly populates the equator of the Streamer belt during a minimum solar rotation.

\item  Type I - Small closed field lines in all latitudes, with $\dr \Tm > 0$. %This class thoroughly populates the inner of the Streamer belt.

\item  Type II - Large closed field lines (meaning their apex surpasses the DEMT range of heights) in the latitudes range $[-90\mdeg,-30\mdeg] \cup [+30\mdeg,+90\mdeg]$ and $\dr \Tm > 0$. %This class is mostly populated by very large trans-equatorial field lines forming the envelope of the Streamer belt. 

\item Type III - Open field lines (meaning with apex out the DEMT range of heights) in the latitudes range $[-90\mdeg,-60\mdeg] \cup [+60\mdeg,+90\mdeg]$ and $\dr \Tm > 0$.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{{Energy input flux}}\label{energia} 

\noindent\notebyalbert{This section will summarize how loop integrated energy quantities are computed from the DEMT products and the AWSoM magetic model alone. The summary will not include any derivation and will refer to Cecilia's paper. Only the results that are relevant are to be explicited. Start by explaining the model and assumptions, and end up summarizing the loop-integrated products (radiative and conductive fluxes). At the end the reader should understand that their sum is the enery input flux required at the coronal base to maintain the loop stable. This should be a very short section, as it is a summary of one previous paper alone.}

%correcciones a hacer! DIEGO
%Los términos de la Eq (10) requieren ser explicados. La explicación a conituación no es clara, y de hecho está mal escrita. La Eq. (7) se integra en el VOLUMEN CORONAL COMPLETO de cada tubo de flujo y se divide por el área basal del mismo. Utilizando la condición solenoidal de B se llega a la Eq. (7), dónde... y ahí deberían darse las expresiones de Phir y Phic porque no pertenecen a la literatura estandard, y explicar a continuación como todos los elementos de esas dos expresiones surgen de los fits de DEMT y del modelo magnético de AWSoM. Donde si se puede ahorrar mucho espacio es en lo previo, la Eq (8) podría no incluirse por ejemplo. Creo que ahora lo mejor es que trates de completar la explicación dando las expresiones de Phir y Phic, y luego vemos de como limarla, probablemente eliminando la ec. (8). y además el texto puede compactarse, corregirse y reordenarse mucho. Poné las unidades de las cantidades Phi entre paréntesis a continuación de $\Phi_{h,r,c}$.

Due the difference between temperatures of transition region and solar corona, there must to be a heating mechanism that compensate all the losses present in the atmosphere and maintain stable the plasma temperature. Previous works have studied this mechanism by observations and modeling, but mostly for active regions. \citet{maccormack_2017} have developed a technique that estimate the heating injected into the loops during a period of minima activity. Using DEMT combined with an extrapolation of magnetic field, as we detailed before, they obtain the different plasma parameters along each magnetic loop, and therefore, compute the energy input flux required to maintain them stable.
The model assume a simple energy balance for each magnetic flux tube, where the losses by radiative power ($E_r$) and thermal conduction power ($E_c$) are compensated by some coronal heating power($E_h$) \citep{aschwanden_2004}:

\begin{equation}\label{Balance}
E_h(s) = E_r(s)+ E_c(s),
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $s$ is the position along each magnetic flux tube and the powers are in units of $[{\rm erg\,sec^{-1}\,cm^{-3}}]$.

\noindent\notebyalbert{Trabajé todo lo naranja. Primero decidí que es mejor no numerar $E_c$ sino $F_c$. Eso te quedará claro cuando agregues las ecuaciones (11) y (12) que te indico más abajo y leas el último párrafo naranja de abajo, ahí cierra todo. Además describí que son los $\phi$ en forma correcta. El texto previo estaba muy flojón, entre otras cosas se hablaba de una (inexistente) ``conductive loss function" y de una (incorrectamente denominada) ``area along the loop". Obviamente luego de chequear este texto naranja borrá esta nota azul en particular.}

\albert{The thermal conduction power $E_c$ equals the divergence of the conductive heat flux $F_c$, i.e.
$E_c(s)=[1/A(s)]\,{\rm d}[A(s)\,F_c(s)]/{\rm d}s$, where $A(s)$ is the transversal area of the magnetic flux tube at position $s$. Under a quiescent solar corona plasma regime, the conductive flux is assumed to be dominated by the electron thermal conduction, described by the usual Spitzer model \citep{spitzer_1962}
\begin{equation}\label{Fc}
F_c(s)=-\kappa_0\,{T(s)}^{5/2}\,\frac{dT}{ds}(s),
\end{equation}
where $\kappa_0 = 9.2 \times 10^{-7}  {\rm erg\,sec^{-1}\,K^{-7/2}}$ is the Spitzer thermal conductivity.}

Radiative power depends on the amount of plasma in certain temperatures that can radiate. The model estimate it by integrating the squared density multiplied by a radiative loss function $\Lambda(T)$. This function depends on plasma temperature and is calculated by the atomic database and the plasma emission model from CHIANTI \citep{delzanna_2015}. Then, the expression for radiative power obtained is:

\begin{equation}\label{Er}
E_r = \int\,\textrm{d}T\,\LDEM(T)\,\Lambda(T)
\end{equation}

\albert{The energy balance given by Equation (\ref{Balance}) is then integrated in the volume of any given coronal magnetic flux tube. Dividing the result by the flux tube ara at the coronal base, and making use of the soleidonal conditon of the magnetic field, a field-line integrated version of that energy balance is found,
\begin{equation}\label{FluxBalance}
\phi_h = \phi_r + \phi_c.
\end{equation}
\noindent
where the line integrated flux quantities $\phi_{r,c}\,[\rm{erg\,sec^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}]$ are given by \citep{maccormack_2017},}\\
\notebyalbert{Diego, please include here Equations (11) and (12) of that paper, which incredibly enough will have the same numbers here.}

{To perform a comparative study of the thermodynamic structure of the inner corona in different solar cycles
we carry out a DEMT reconstruction for two rotations: CR-2082, using STEREO/EUVI data and CR-2208, using SDO/AIA data.} {Once the LDEM was determined for each rotation, the square root of the mean value of the electron density squared $\sqravgN$ and the electron mean temperature $\Tm$ were computed at each voxel of the tomographic computational grid by means of Equations \ref{momento1} and \ref{momento2}.} As an example, Figures \ref{carmaps_demt_2082} and \ref{carmaps_demt_2208} show the latitude-longitude maps of DEMT results for both rotations at {three different heights of interest. The lowest height where the tomography gives results, the lowest height where the AWSoM model results are reliable and a representative average height were selected, that is $r=$1.025, 1.065 and 1.105, $\mrsun$ respectively}. Black voxels correspond to non-reconstructed voxels (explained in Section \ref{demt}). Thick-black curve indicates the magnetic open/closed boundary based on the magnetic field of AWSoM model. 


While CR-2082 was highly axisymmetric and showed two ARs (active region) in latitude $+30\mdeg$ and longitude $50\mdeg$ and $120\mdeg$. CR-2208 showed two AR, one around latitude $+5\mdeg$ and longitude $140\mdeg$ and the other around latitude-longitud $+5\mdeg$, $300\mdeg$. Except for these ARs, in both rotations the open-closed boundaries derived from the respective AWSoM model match the shape of the contour levels of the tomographic maps of both the electron density and the electron mean temperature. In the AR, there is a lack of match between the open-closed boundaries and the tomographic reconstructions of density and temperature, that is why those ranges were excluded from the analysis. 

\temp{PARRAFO CORTO DE OBSERVACIONES QUE LUEGO SERAN CORROBORADAS CON HISTOGRAMAS.}
A visual inspection of Figures \ref{momento1} and \ref{momento2} suggest/indicates that the streamer region of CR-2082 was denser and colder than CR-2208. In both rotations, but specifically in CR-2082 the temperature in the equatorial latitudes tend to decrease with height while the latitudes between the open-close boundaries and the equatorial latitudes tend to increase. These thermodynamic structures have been reported for other rotations in previous works \citep{lloveras_2017}. Closed regions are characterized by relatively larger values of density and temperature in comparison to the open regions.

{To study the variation of the DEMT results in different magnetic structures we traced $\sqravgN$ and $\Tm$ along the magnetic field lines of the AWSoM model.} For both rotations, all field lines that meet the criteria listed in Section \ref{trace} were selected. For each field line, the data points of electron density and electron mean temperature as a function of height were fitted to the Equations \ref{Nfit} and \ref{Tfit}.



As a result, the electron density $N_0(r=1.0\,\mrsun)$ and scale height $\lN$ were computed for each leg, as well as the temperature gradient $\dr \Tm$, and the height-averaged (along the leg) {electron temperature} $\aTm$. As the DEMT technique studies only coronal conditions, \textit{i.e.} above height $r\approx 1.025\,\mrsun$, the exponential fit to the electron density data as a function of height may be used to compute the tomographic electron density at the coronal base $\sqravgN(r=1.025\,\mrsun)$ as in previous articles. In this case, for further comparison analysis with the AWSoM results, we selected the lowest height where the results of the MHD model are reliable, that is $1,055\,\mrsun$.



\diego{
As a way of knowing the physical position of all traced lines, Figure \ref{rpoint_demt} shows the latitudinal-longitudinal location of all open and closed file lines traced in gray scale at $1.105\,\mrsun$ for both rotations, where the ARs where excluded. At top, all traced legs with enaugh tomographic data are shown. In black all legs corresponding to closed lines and in grey corresponding to open lines. This traced lines were divided into four types as explained in Section \ref{trace} and the fit in density and temperature was applied, selecting only those legs that met the criteria. The bottom figure shows the latitudinal-longitudinal location of this selected lines at same height. In blue the type 0 lines are indicated, populating the most equatorial latitudes (dominated mostly by down legs). This kind of structures has been informed in previous works, \citet{lloveras_2017} observed down legs in a rotation during the solar minima of 1996 and for the previous rotation CR-2081. A decrease in the amount of down legs in equatorial latitudes could be an indicator of increased coronal activity \citet{nuevo_2013}. In red the type I lines, populating all the streamer but mostly the mid latitudes. In violet the type II lines, which are mostly very large trans-equatorial field lines forming the envelope of the Streamer belt, and in green dots the type III lines, populating the coronal holes.
}

Of the 45000 legs selected in 2082, 14\% are type 0, 38\% are type I, 23\% are type II and 25\% type III, on the other hand of the 59000 legs selected in 2208, 8\% are type 0, 43\% are type I, 22\% are type II and 30\% type III.

This selection of types of lines automatically leads to specific regions arranged along all longitudes associated with different thermodynamic, with good symmetry between both hemispheres in both rotations.%, this is because the rotations are at a minimum of activity and the static corona is a good approximation.

To compare obtained traced results in both rotations and for each type of lines (associated with differents types of regions), Figure \ref{gradt_demt} shows histograms (normalized to the total amount of the field lines selected) of the temperature radial gradients ($\dr \Tm$). The lack of population around values close to zero is due to the requirement $|\rho_t| > 0.5$ which discards quasi-isothermal legs.

Both rotations are characterized by lines of type 0 with mean values of $-2.5\, \rm MK/\mrsun$, mean values of $2.3\, \rm MK/\mrsun$ in type I and $2.4\, \rm MK/\mrsun$ in type II. The only notable difference is the smaller number of type 0 lines in CR-2208 and the mean value of $4.5\, \rm MK/\mrsun$ in type III for CR-2208 which is twice that for the other rotation.

\diego{si queda una asociacion directa entre los tipos de lineas y las estructuras de streamer, CH etc entonces usaria esos nombres a continuacion.}\\
From the equatorial streamer of both rotations, increasing latitudes show decreasing {coronal base} density, and increasing density scale height and electron temperature. In both rotations the CH regions are characterized sub-MK temperatures, and coronal base densities of order $\approx 1/2$ of the equatorial streamer. Histograms with sharp populations indicates that for both rotations the values of all physical quantities exhibit a strong symmetry between both hemispheres. 


A comparison of the results between the two rotations shows that CR-2208 is characterized by lower values (between $11\%\, \rm and\, 16\%$) of coronal base electron density than CR-2082, higher values of density scale height (between $4\%\, \rm and\,19\%$) and higher values of electron temperature (between $6\%\, \rm and\,21\%$).

%To establish if the differences in the results between the two rotations are significant, Section \ref{uncertainties} estimates the error bars due the dominating systematic uncertainties.
%\diego{quizas vale la pena introducir alguna comparacion sobre el campo magnetico, veremos como quedan los comentarios de ceci.}
%{Also, within the streamer belt the magnetic field strength is similar in both rotations in the northern hemisphere, while in the southern hemisphere CR-1915 exhibits $10-80\%$ larger values compared to CR-2081, with increasing difference for larger latitudes. In the coronal holes, the magnetic field strength of CR-1915 is much larger than for CR-2081, exhibiting values up to 50\% larger in the northern hemisphere and more than twice larger in the southern hemisphere.}



%Previous works have found magnetic loops which temperature decrease with height, most generally in equatorial latitudes \citep{huang_2012,nuevo_2013}. This type of loops with negative gradients produce a negative conductive flux that contribute to the heating in the corona. In this work, we compute the loop-integrated energy quantities separately in three different populations of loops. 

To compare integrated quantities along loops, we select those close loops where both legs meet the requirements of Section \ref{trace}. In an analogous way to the legs definition, we will refer to them as loops of type 0, I or II to those whose both legs meeting the criteria. When two legs of the same loop have a decreasing temperature with height (type 0), they are called down loops.

Type 0 loops present slightly larger gradients than type I. Therefore, type 0 present bigger amount, in modulus, of loop-integrated conductive flux. Due conductive flux negative can not be assumed as a loss but it can be contributing to the coronal heating. Thus, to compensate the radiative losses, a lower loop-integrated energy input flux ($\phi_h$) is required.

We can see, on type 0 loops, a median value of energy input flux for CR2082 twice bigger than CR2208. Also, in both rotations, we observe a negative population of loop integrated energy input flux. This can refer to some loops where loop-integrated radiative flux is too small in comparison with the larger gradients of negative conductive flux, resulting in negative energy input flux. 

The type I loops show a loop-integrated positive conductive for each loop in both rotations consistent with positive gradients of temperatures. The conductive flux have values around 0.3 $10^{5}[\rm{erg\,sec^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}]$ in both rotations. Similar results have been found for loop-integrated radiative flux and energy input flux for both rotations.

\subsection{Tomography and Models}\label{awsom_res} 

\noindent\notebyalbert{This section will show the results of AWSoM for $N_e$ and $T_e$, and how they compare with the corresponding results of DEMT ($\sqravgN$ and $\Tm$). It will first show the Carrington maps of $N_e$ and $T_e$ at the same three heights we showed the same maps for the DEMT results. Then it will show the lat/lon location of loops of type I, II and III at a middle height, just loke for DEMT results. As the two targets are highly axis-symmetric, a first quantitative comparison between AWSoM and DEMT will be shown as longitude-averaged latitudinal profiles of the results of both models at a sample height. To make comparisons in distinct magnetic structures, we will also show the average radial dependence of results for loops of type I, II and III, overplotting the AWSoM and the DEMT results. For the tree types of loops we will show histograms of the DEMT and AWSoM products along field lines. This is a LOT of information from which and we need to pull out a few clear conlcusions.}

The thermodynamic results of AWSoM are shown in Figures \ref{carmaps_awsom_2082} and \ref{carmaps_awsom_2208}. That is latitude-longitude maps for $\Ne$ and $\Te$ modeled for CR-2082 and CR-2208 at $r=1.025, 1.065$ and $1.105\,\mrsun$. The black curve denotes the same open-close boundary showed in Figures \ref{carmaps_demt_2082} and \ref{carmaps_demt_2208} respectively.

%$r=1.025, 1.065$ and $1.105\,\mrsun$. The black curve denotes the open-close boundary.

A visual inspection of these maps shows that both reconstructions are very axysimmetric for $\Ne$ and $\Te$ as well. The closed region is denser and hotter than the open region. The density and temperature gradients are maximum in the open-close boundary. The open field regions in low latitudes maintain thermodynamic values associated with open regions. The reconstruction of CR-2082 does not show clear the ARs, while CR-2208 shows a well reconstruction of both AR around latitude-longitud $+5\mdeg$, $140\mdeg$ and $+5\mdeg$, $300\mdeg$. In both rotations the open-closed boundaries derived from the AWSoM model match the shape of the contour levels of both the electron density and the electron temperature.

%\diego{comparacion visual entre estas dos figuras y als dos de DEMT.}

The same intensity scales in both density and temperature can be observed between the tomographic results and those of AWSoM in both rotations, as well as the same thermodinamic structures. That is, equatorial latitudes, mid laditudes and the open regions.

In the same way as in Section \ref{demt_res}, the model results were traced along the magnetic lines obtained with it. This allowed to obtain $\Ne(r)$ and $T_e(r)$ along the magnetic lines and fit them to the Equations \ref{Nfit} and \ref{Tfit}.

The actual version of the AWSoM model can not reproduce down legs, so for a further comparison we only select lines of type I, II and III of those meeting the criteria described in Section \ref{trace}.

As a way to understand the distribution of legs, Figure \ref{rpoint_awsom} shows the latitudinal-longitudinal location of the traced legs at top and the selected fitted legs meeting the criteria at $1.105\,\mrsun$ for both rotations, in the same way as in Section \ref{demt_res}. In red the type I lines, populating mostly the entire streamer. In violet the type II lines, populating the edge that assemble the envelope around the streamer, and in green dots the type III lines, populating the coronal holes.

The reader may notice that these structures are the same as those in Figure \ref{rpoint_demt} but more filled. The cause is twofold, on the one hand the same magnetic model was used to trace both DEMT and AWSoM results, on the other hand is because giving the model smoother results, fewer fitted lines are filtered.

To highlight the latitudinal structures observed in Figures \ref{carmaps_demt_2082} and \ref{carmaps_awsom_2082} for CR-2082 as well as Figures \ref{carmaps_demt_2208} and \ref{carmaps_awsom_2208} for CR-2208, Figure \ref{perf_lat} shows for both rotations the latitudinal variation  of both the electron density and the electron mean temperature at the height $r=1.105\,\mrsun$, averaged over all longitudes (excluding the AR). DEMT results are shown in blue lines while AWSoM results in red. While the temperature shows a maximum in each hemisphere, the density has a simpler behavior, with higher values in the low-latitudes of the streamer and a nearly monotonic decrease towards larger latitudes. The vertical black lines denotes the average of the open-close boundary in both hemispheres to each rotation.

\diego{Me gustaria hacer un comentario de cierre para esta figura que refiera las Figuras 3 y 9, como la linea de abajo, y que conecte con los histogramas que vienen a continuacion. Si no queda bien, hay que mover esta figura entre la actual figura 8 y 9.}

This longitude-averaged behaviors match well with the physical locations of the legs shown in Figures \ref{rpoint_awsom} and \ref{rpoint_demt}.

According to the visual inspection on the maps of carrington, the latitudinal profiles comparing both DEMT and AWSoM results are on the same scale. Little difference in density is observed in CR-2208 and in temperature in CR-2082, while DEMT in CR-2082 was $20\%$ denser. Finally, DEMT results for CR-2208 were $25\%$ hotter in the streamer and $30\%$ colder in the polar zone than AWSoM.
Density profiles on AWSoM show an increase around the polar zone, which seems like an artifice.

To summarize the comparison between both results during both rotations at full height, it is shown in Figure \ref{perfiles_promedio} the average fits of $\Ne(r)$ and $T_e(r)$ for legs of type I (blue), II (red), and III (green) for both rotations.

In average all temperature and density behavior from both results are on the same scale.
The coronal base densities of AWSoM were lower than those of DEMT in CR-2082 and higher in CR-2208. The fact that the density decays to similar values between both results suggests a similar height scale. Onthe other hand basal temperature of AWSoM was lower in both rotations, but the temperature gradients are very similar en each type of legs, showing a very similar increase of temperature with height.

Tu summary the statistical comparison, Figure \ref{histos_2082} and \ref{histos_2208} shows the statistical results of both rotations for the three types of field lines traced with DEMT (blue) and AWSoM results (red). From left to right the panels show the statistical distribution of $\NCB$, $\lN$ and $\aTm$. For all types of lines, Table \ref{tabla_comp} summarizes the median value of the statidtical distribution of each physical quantity derived from the analysis. The DEMT quantities are expressed as absoulte values, while for ASWSoM they are informed relative to the corresponding result for DEMT.

%This plot (E) has never been shown before and I believe it is a very nice result. There are of course previous studies on this, but this would be the first time this is evaluated with tomography. It is not the terminal speed, but it already shows the fast/slow components. We can show this, or we can go for more. Diego can QUANTIFY the correlation by carefully mapping all open field lines at 6 Rsun down to the DEMT region. He needs to code a bit more to achieve this goal, but we believe it is worth. With that tool done Diego can explore other terminal values of quantities of the AWSoM model and the DEMT results below (expansion factor maybe?). This will be nice to do also for the July-2-2019 Eclipse rotation that we will analyze after this paper.

For each rotation, everything to the south of the HCS maps down to the southern open region in the Figures \ref{perf_lat}, and the same for the northern hemisphere, showing an anti-correlation between $\Ne$ at low heights and high $V_r$ at $6\,\mrsun$.

Note that while in this Figure all latitudes are magnetically open, in Figure 10 only the part at latitudes larger than the vertical black lines are open. Note that DEMT shows that in the open low corona $N_e$ dereases from the O/C boundary towards the poles, anti-correlating with the AWSoM terminal speed, which is nice. In order to quantify this anti-correlation we need to trace the termnal speed and the DEMT $N_e$, which we may need to do with the help of Chip and Nishtha. Chip, we can discuss this idea over Skype after Xmas if you are around.}}

\section{Discussion}\label{discu} 

\noindent\notebyalbert{(by Albert) This section will discuss and summarize some main conclusions, possibly in three groups: a) DEMT analysis alone (including thermodynamical structure, up/down loops, energy considerations, etc.), b) Comparison AWSoM/DEMT (longitude-averaged latitudinal profiles, height-dependence profiles in different magnetic structures, etc), and c) Correlation betweem AWSoM terminal wind speed and DEMT basal density, I will expand on this later this week as this may require help from Michigan).} 

\diego{NOTE: Here is a paragraph describing the empirical successes in the reconstruction of both rotations.}

*In comparing the DEMT results obtained for the two selected targets, it is important to bear in mind they rely on data provided by two different instruments: AIA and EUVI. In order to quantify the systematic difference of the DEMT products based on both instruments, \citet{nuevo_2015}, who were the first to apply DEMT to AIA data, analyzed a single target using both instruments independently. They found that while the density product is essentially equal, the temperature product of DEMT based on AIA data is systematically 8\% larger than the one based on EUVI data, i.e. $\Tm^{\rm(AIA)}/\Tm^{\rm(EUVI)} \approx 1.08$. Considering such correction, Figure \ref{histos_fulldemt} and Table \ref{tabla_demt} indicate that CR-2208 was $\approx 10-15\%$ hotter than CR-2082 throughout the streamer belt region. As for the electron density products, CR-2208 was found to be $\approx 15-20\%$ less dense than CR-2082 throughout the streamer belt region. These systematic differences are beyond the uncertainty level in the DEMT products due to systematic sources (radiometric calibration and tomographic regularization), that \citet{lloveras_2017} estimated to be $\lesssim 5\%$ and $\approx 2\%$ for the electron temperature and density, respectively.


*Coronal magnetic structures for which the temperature increases/decreases with height in the range of heights covered by DEMT, $1.02–1.22\,\mrsun$, have been dubbed as “up”/“down” loops by \citet{huang_2012} and \citet{nuevo_2013}, who first observed their presence by means of DEMT. As speculated by the authors of those works, loops of type down can be expected if the heating deposition is strongly confined near the coronal base of a magnetic loop. Down loops were first predicted by \citet{serio_1981}, and later on by \citet{aschwanden_2002}. In a recent study by \citet{schiff_2016}, down and up loops have been successfully reproduced by a numerical implementation of a 1D steady-state model that considers time-averaged heating rates. 

We found down legs in the DEMT reconstructions mainly in the equatorial latitudes, being a greater quantity and better distribution along longitudes in CR-2082 than in CR-2208. \citet{nuevo_2013} showed a decrease in the amount of down loops as the solar activity increases, which is consistent with the results shown in this article.


*We can see, on type 0 loops, a median value of energy input flux ($\phi_h$) for CR-2082 twice bigger than CR-2208. In both rotations this magnitude has negative values, this can refer to some loops where loop-integrated radiative flux $\phi_r$) is too small in comparison with the larger gradients of negative conductive flux $\phi_c$), resulting in negative energy input flux. 

This effect can be due a subestimation of the density present in the loop or the limited range of temperature used to reconstruct tomographic parameters, that can affect the compute of radiative power. Nevertheless, this population represent lower than the \diego{ALGÚN PORCENTAJE$\%$} of total population in both cases.

Consistent that the density in CR-2082 was higher, the $\phi_r$ was also higher. In both rotations the magnitudes in the temperature gradients are similar, but the temperatures in CR-2208 were consistently higher at all heights, resulting in a larger $\phi_c$ in module. This results are in agree with the observations of \citet{maccormack_2017}.

\diego{THE AR of CR-2082 wasn't well modeled by AWSoM.}

In both rotations, AWSoM and DEMT resutls shows same termodynamic structures along latitude and longitude with very comparable values between $1.055 - 1.25\,\mrsun$

Figure \ref{histos_2082} and Table \ref{tabla_comp} indicate that AWSoM reconstruction of CR-2082 was found to be less dense $\approx 11-22\%$ and colder $\approx 5-10\%$.

Both reconstructions of CR-2208 reconstructed the ARs with very similare values and in almost the same latitude-longitude location. Figure \ref{histos_2208} and Table \ref{tabla_comp} indicate that AWSoM reconstruction of CR-2208 was found to be denser $\approx 0-10\%$ and colder $\approx 10-15\%$.

CR-2208 was $\approx 10-15\%$ hotter than CR-2082 throughout the streamer belt region. As for the electron density products, CR-2208 was found to be $\approx 15-20\%$ less dense than CR-2082 throughout the streamer belt region. These systematic differences are beyond the uncertainty level in the DEMT products due to systematic sources (radiometric calibration and tomographic regularization), that \citet{lloveras_2017} estimated to be $\lesssim 5\%$ and $\approx 2\%$ for the electron temperature and density, respectively.

\diego{I would like to say something about FIgure 10. Maybe the weird tale in AWSoM Ne in the poles. Ideas?}\\

\diego{We could say something about the anti correlation between speed and density and not get into the trace because issues do always appear and we don't have much time, and we all want to be happy in january. Unless the collaborators find easy to make this part.}
