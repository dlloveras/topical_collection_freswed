ABSTRACT: Observational tools play an essential role in advancing our understanding of the physics of the solar corona. They provide validation data to improve three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the solar atmosphere, key to enhance their space weather forecasting capabilities. Solar rotational tomography (SRT) is currently the sole observational technique that provides an empirical 3D description of fundamental plasma parameters of the solar corona at a global scale. Based on EUV data of space borne instruments, SRT allows constructing 3D maps of the coronal electron density and temperature at heliocentric heights below 1.25 Rsun. We carry out a study of the corona combining tomographic reconstructions with MHD simulations of the latest version of the Alfvén Wave Solar Model (AWSoM) of the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF). Target rotations were selected from the solar minimum between solar cycles (SC) 23 and 24 and the current declining phase of solar cycle 24. Tomographic reconstructions and results of the model are analyzed in distinct coronal magnetic structures. We study magnetically closed structures associated with the equatorial streamer belt, as well as magnetically open regions enclosing it. We report on the tomographic results in the different structures, their implications for the physics of the solar corona, and the capability of the AWSoM model to reproduce the tomographic reconstructions in different regions.

The contribution fits the following FRESWED topics:

-Tools and simulations for space weather predictions
-Coronal large-scale structuring and coupling with the solar wind
